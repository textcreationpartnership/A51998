            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN firſt my Thoughts were exerciſed in drawing up ſome Reaſons, to juſtifie our keeping the firſt day of the Week a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; they were only deſigned for Private Uſe and to ſerve a particular Occaſion, that called for them. But ſince the Providence of God, has lead my Meditations farther into this Subject from other Conſiderations, and by means of a Book late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Tho. Bampfield</hi> for preſſing the ſeventh day (or <hi>Saturday</hi>) Sabbath as the Duty of all Chriſtians to keep Holy in Obedience to Gods command: I have Thought it needful to preſent this Treatiſe, for the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of thoſe that are unſettled in their Minds about it, and for their Advantage who through the tolderneſs of their Conſciences are expoſed to divers difficulties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot ſee that Liberty to be lawful, which others take in making the Jewiſh Sabbath a working day.</p>
            <p>To help therefore thoſe ſincere Chriſtians (tho but few in number) that are intangled with this Yoak of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; I have conſidered diver. Authors on their ſeventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Sabbath, as beſides the two Books of Mr. <hi>Edw. Sten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi> Mr. <hi>H. Soursby</hi> and Mr. <hi>M. Smiths</hi> Mr. <hi>VVill. Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Theophilus Brabourn,</hi> and the aforeſaid Mr. <hi>Tho. Bampfields</hi> two late Treatiſes, which tho I have not dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the following Diſcourſe in Anſwer to any one of
<pb facs="tcp:59311:3"/>them (except in ſome particulars) yet the Ingenious Reader may find, I have taken Notice of the Chiefeſt Grounds and Arguments for their Sabbath contained in them all. And if the Lord will graciouſly bleſs my well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meant endeavours for their right Information, and hereby remove that bar between them and others, or if any Benefit ſhall be received from this Improvement of my Talent, I deſire He may have the Praiſe to whom alone it is due. However, thô we or others may differ in ſome particulars, thrô the various Sence we have of the Mind of God revealed in his Word; yet as through the Grace of Chriſt, we abhorr that which is Evil, and cleave to that which is good, with a Holy Deteſta <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n of all apparent Tranſgreſſions of the Law, conſiſtent with Love and Pity to mens Perſons; and as we are Children of one Father, and Co-heirs of Eternal Life through Faith in Chriſt that worketh by Love, we ought to be united in kind Affections to one another. And were our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences managed more in Brotherly Charity, and by the gracious Conduct of the Holy Spirit, controverſial Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes would be more acceptable, the Reputation of Religion and our mutual Peace and Love would be better preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which as I ſpeak this more in general, than deſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any particular Reflection on my aforeſaid Brethren, ſo I deſire always my ſelf to watch, and labour to abound in this Grace of Love, which is the Bond of Perfection.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, I have in the following Tract not only made the beſt Improvement I can of ſeveral things that others have wrote before me, but as the Lord hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned my Underſtanding, I have added ſuch Matters, which I believe may be uſeful to clear the Caſe in hand, hoping he will graciouſly Bleſs my Labour to your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Reader may not be under any miſtake about the uſe I make of the word <hi>Moral</hi> throughout this Treatiſe, I ſhall here acquaint him, that in its ſelf it belongeth to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Civility or Behaviour, properly to the Actions of Man, only as he is Man: And ſo by ſome the Moral Law is taken for the Law, Light, or Inſtinct of Nature which <hi>Adam</hi> had in the State of Innocency; which altho this be true, yet I alſo make a larger uſe of the word: For as no Man knoweth by Nature the extent of <hi>Adams</hi> light in all particulars, for his Obedience when he was in Innocency, and therefore cannot deſcribe the whole of that Law of Nature: And as I ſuppoſe the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, will not be deny'd by any to have been binding for all his poſterity as Men; ſo we muſt have recourſe to Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the better underſtanding our Moral and univerſal Duty to God, ſince the Law of Nature is ſo much obliterated in us through the fall. And therefore becauſe of the darkneſs and depravity of our Minds, we have the ſubſtance of the Law of Nature given to us in written Precents, which may be called Moral, as they are not Ceremonial, but perpetually and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally binding to all Men for their Obedience unto God, and alſo Inſtitutions by Divine Revelation, as being now a more full diſcovery to us of the Mind of God firſt implanted in our innocent Parents, than we retain in our Natures, or can reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in our fall. So that when I ſpeak of the Moral Law, or of Morality, it muſt be taken as the Adjunct Matter governs it in either ſence, of the Law or Light of Nature alone in the State of Innocency, or contained in thoſe tranſcribed Precepts of the Ten Commandments, as the ſubſtance thereof in general Heads, and in thoſe other Precepts that morally do explain them, which I ſhall only take notice of wherein I am concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not collect and reſerr them all to their proper Heads. In brief, I uſe the word <hi>Moral</hi> in common to thoſe things that are of univerſal and perpetual Concern to all Mankind for their Obedience to God as their Creator: For as to the caſe before us, ſeeing its ſaid, that <hi>God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it:</hi> We cannot ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> by his pure Light of Nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone knew that it was meeteſt to have but ſix working days, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59311:5"/>no leſs, as 5, 7, or 8 together to one Sabbath, but that from God's Example revealed to him, the light of <hi>Adams</hi> Nature told him that it was moſt meet for him to divide his time like his Creator, and ſo it became the Moral Duty of Men as Men to have no more nor leſs than ſix working or common days to one Sabbath.</p>

               <p>TO proceed on the Subject Matter of this Treatiſe, I ſhall here recite the firſt Foundation Scripture for keeping the ſeventh day Sabbath, as a boundary to ſix working days, and briefly Note ſomething of the Nature and Quality of the Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>And on the ſeventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he reſted on the ſeventh day from all his work which he had made. And God bleſſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in it he had reſted from all his work, which God created and made.</hi> It is here ſaid, <hi>God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it;</hi> that is, he made it a happy and holy day, by ſetting it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from common uſe for Man to worſhip him, and he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it to be a reſt for <hi>Adam</hi> by Revelation, as he did that he ſhould not eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, for otherwiſe <hi>Adam</hi> could not by his Light of Nature alone know the time which had paſſed before he was Created, nor could he underſtand the Mind of God as it was in God himſelf, and therefore the knowledge <hi>Adam</hi> had of God's ſanctifying the ſeventh day Sabbath, was by Supernatural Revelation to him.</p>
               <p>And this I preſume none will deny, for a time for Man to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain or reſt from his own buſineſs, to exert his ſolemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to God, is morally implanted in the Heart of Man by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſurely God did not conceal from <hi>Adam</hi> the meeteſt time when he ſanctified the firſt ſeventh day of the World for that end. Beſides, before that God had formed <hi>Eve,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.7.8.—15.</note> he put <hi>Adam</hi> into the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> to dreſs it, and to keep it; and therefore <hi>Adam</hi> being appointed to do this buſineſs, he might have applyed himſelf thereto immediately after <hi>Eve</hi> was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and brought to him, if he had not received the knowledge of God's ſanctifying the ſeventh Day, yea then it had been lawful for him to have worked on God's Sabbath, if it had not been revealed to him.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59311:6"/>
               <p>Moreover, Our Saviour puts this matter clearly out of doubt, becauſe he referrs the making of the Sabbath (not to the firſt Inſtitution of it at the gathering of Manna in the Wilderneſs, but) to the time of God's creating Man,
<note place="margin">Mark 2.27.</note> ſaying, <hi>The Sabbath was made for Man, and not Man for the Sabbath;</hi> that is, the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was not firſt made, and then Man for the ſake of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, but Man was firſt Created, and then the Sabbath was ſanctified for his Happineſs, as the bleſſing of it ſignifieth. God's bare ceaſing from Work did not make it for Man, but his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying it, or ſetting that time apart from the common uſe of Man for the ſervice and worſhip of his Creator, and then we have reaſon to believe he did immediately reveal the knowledge of it to <hi>Adam,</hi> that he might anſwer the deſign of God in ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the ſeventh day for him, and to make it a pattern for aſter Ages.</p>
               <p>But ſome have ſaid, That the ſanctifying of the ſeventh-day Sabbath, on which God reſted from his Work of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was written by way of Anticipation of the Order of time in <hi>Moſes</hi> Sacred Hiſtory, and ſo thô God reſted the ſeventh day from all his Works, yet the Sabbath was not ſanctified for Man till after <hi>Iſraels</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This is a weak and groundleſs Notion that ſome have taken up, as will appear from the proper ſence of the Text, and the Reaſons following. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's ſaid, That <hi>on the ſeventh day God ended his Work which he had made: and he reſted on the ſeventh day from all his Work which he had made.</hi> From whence it's plain, that God's ſeventh day on which he reſted from his Work of Creation, was that ſame ſeventh day on which he ended his Work, elſe how could it be ſaid he <hi>reſted from his work on the ſeventh day,</hi> if his ſeventh day reſt was not immediately aſter it was ended?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's ſaid, <hi>God bleſſed the ſeventh day, and ſanctified it: becauſe that in it he had reſted from all his work, which God created and made.</hi> Now what ſeventh day can this be, which God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſanctiſied, but the ſame ſeventh day on which he ended his Work, from which ſence for any to invert the Text, is a groſs and paſpable wrong to it; for God ſanctified <hi>[<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>HERE I come to open and explain the Law of God which commandeth the ſeventh day to be obſerved; and becauſe I find that ſome have taken up an Opinion, and (I conceive for the ſake of nothing elſe but to eſcape the Arguments which ſome have drawn from the fourth Commandment, for keeping the Jewiſh ſeventh day Sabbath) do aſſert that there is nothing of the Law as given on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> binding to us under the Goſpel, or that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it is obliging to us but what is given forth again, and confirmed to us in the New Teſtament.

But as the Law given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was the Subſtance of the Law of Nature in our firſt Parents, or of Creation again renewed in Tables of Stone, and committed to <hi>Iſrael</hi> as the declarative Will of God, ſo it was for the uſe of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo. For ſeeing our Sin and depravity of Nature through the fall, does not weaken the Authority of Gods Law over us;
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.3.

Moreover as the Moral Law written in Tables of Stone was the declarative Will of God, ſtrengthning the Obligation of the ſame Law written in the Heart of Man by Nature; ſo Chriſt in the Goſpel does not any ways diſſolve, but much ſtrengthneth this Obligation to us all. And to this agreeth, the Aſſemblies, the Congregational Churches, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Baptiſts Confeſſion of Faith, recommended by the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of, and concerned for upwards of one hundred Baptized Congregations, denying Arminianiſm; wherein <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. are

               <p n="3">3.

And the Apoſtle farther ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59311:11"/>both of the Jews and Gentiles, concludeth with theſe words, <hi>Do we then make void the Law through faith?
<note place="margin">Chap. 3.29, 30, 31.</note> God forbid: yea we eſtabliſh tie Law.</hi> And ſo doth the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> who wrote to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Jews, that had the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>If ye fulfil the Royal Law according to the Scripture,
<note place="margin">James 2.8, 9. Chap. 2.1.</note> Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf, ye do well. But if ye have reſpect to perſons, ye commit ſin, and are convinced of the law as tranſgreſſors. For whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offends in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> From whence I obſerve, that the believing Jews were ſtill under the Obligation of the Moral Law as a Rule of Holy Life, which of its ſelf, or by its own Authority, is binding under the Goſpel; for elſe if it had been abrogated by the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Miniſtration, the Apoſtle would not have cited the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> out of the Old Teſtament as the Obligation of their Obedience, as the Apoſtle farther argueth in <hi>Ver.</hi> 11, 12. and exhorteth them ſo to ſpeak and do, <hi>as they that ſhall be judged by the Law of liberty;</hi> that is as much as to ſay, that they ſhould be judged by the Law, under the relief and benefit of the Grace of Chriſt in the Goſpel: So then, if the believing Jews under the Goſpel are made Tranſgreſſors by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſheweth) it is a clear Demonſtration, that the Law is ſtill of its ſelf binding to them; and it being the ſame in ſubſtance as the Law written in the Heart of Man by Nature, (but in a fairer Copy delivered by the Jews to the Gentile Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions now with the Goſpel of Chriſt in the New Teſtament) it is alſo equally binding to us as to the Jews: For if the Jews by Faith in Chriſt are not brought from under the Obligation of the Moral Law, why then ſhould the ſame Faith in the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles excuſe them from it as a Rule.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover, I ſhall farther add, that while the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are throwing down the Types and Shadowy Worſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that legal Diſpenſation,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.8.</note> yet they aſſert that <hi>the Law is good if a man uſe it lawfully, viz.</hi> as a Foundation of our Worſhip and Obedience to God, and juſt behaviour towards Man, which thrô Goſpel Grace after the meaſure we have received, is, or ought to be put forth according to the ſeveral Moral branches of the Law, and the Divine Precepts and Patterns given to us in the New Teſtament. And therefore, we find the Holy Apoſtles, and Goſpel Writers often proving and confirming the Moral part of their Doctrine by the Law, as appears in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. <hi>Children obey your Parents in the Lord, for this is right. Honour thy
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59311:11"/>Father and Mother, (which is the firſt Commandment with promiſe) that it may be well with thee, and thou mayeſt live long on the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Apoſtle confirms his Moral Doctrine to the Gentiles by the Authority of the fifth Commandment, or firſt with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; which plainly ſhews, that it is of its ſelf binding to us all under the Goſpel, and he Moralizeth the Promiſe by ſaying <hi>Earth,</hi> inſtead of <hi>the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee:</hi> So that the Promiſe was not only to pertain to the Jews in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but was perpetually to continue to all the Gentiles: and ſo we may ſay in the aforeſaid caſe of every one that killed a Man unawares, who was to flee into the City of Refuge, and continue there until the Death of the High-prieſt,
<note place="margin">Numb. 35.25.</note> that thô we have no ſuch High-prieſt in Goſpel days, yet the equity of that Law is ſtill in force: But to return to our preſent buſineſs, we may farther find the Apoſtle proveth the moral part of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from the Commendments, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. For in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8, 9, 10. we are exhorted to love one another, <hi>for,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the law;</hi> and he briefly citeth five of the Ten Commandments to confirm the Duty of Love, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth them all: And in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.7, 12. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? is the law ſin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known ſin, but by the Law: for I had not known luſt, except the law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet —Wherefore the law is holy, and the Commandment holy, and juſt, and good.</hi> Therefore ſurely this Moral Precept in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and others in general mentioned by the Apoſtle, are of themſelves binding to us as a Rule of Holy life; for whatſoever Law is morally holy, juſt and good, as this particular precept is, by which the Apoſtle came to the knowledge of Sin, it is perpetually and univerſally binding to all Men,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.14, 15.</note> who have the ſubſtance of it written in their Hearts by Nature: So that from the Apoſtles making uſe of the Anthority of the Moral Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to confirm his Doctrine,
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.19. James 2.8. Chap. 4.11. 1 Joh. 3.4.</note> and from the Commendations of it in the New Teſtament, it clearly appears to be in force unto all Men now under the Goſpel. And ſeeing the fourth Commandment in particular is delivered in ſuch moral Terms, as doth not of its ſelf bind us to the obſervation of the Sabbath after the Jewiſh Pattern, <hi>from Evening to Evening,</hi> any more than after our Chriſtian pattern from Morning to Morning, which does anſwer that Very Precept, as well as theirs did from that ſingle Law; we have then no reaſon to exclude the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59311:12"/>from the reſt of the Decalogue, but to believe it is equally Moral with the other nine, as will appear more patticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the next enſuing Section.</p>

               <p>TO proceed therefore on the fourth Commandment, I ſhall here recite <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.9, 10, 11. <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou ſhalt not do any work — For in ſix days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and reſted the ſeventh day: wherefore the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day, and hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Commandment is morally binding to both Jews and Gentiles, is evident, becauſe it is in ſubſtance the ſame with God's ſanctifying the ſeventh day for Man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. And if the Sabbath be not from thence perpetually binding to all Nations, but reſtrained to the poſterity of the Jews, then by the ſame Rule the Gentiles had no intereſt in the promiſe of the Womans Seed,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> or the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that ſhould bruiſe the Serpents Head, as then made to our firſt Parents; and therefore, as I believe, it will be granted by all Chriſtians, that the Gentiles as well as the Jews had an intereſt in the firſt promiſe as then made, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Original diſcovery of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as well as in thoſe after promiſes that are the fruits and effects of it: So in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we have alſo ground to believe, that the firſt ſanctifying of the Sabbath-day, was from thence (and is alſo from the fourth Commandment) morally binding of its ſelf to both Jews and Gentiles; for if we queſtion the one, we may alſo doubt of the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The End of the fourth Commandment ſheweth it to be a Moral Precept, for a time of reſt is naturally moral, and by the example of God and his ſanctifying the ſeventh day to every ſix working days, it is alſo become morally and perpetually bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for all Men to keep the ſeventh day Sabbath, as a boundary to neither more nor leſs than ſix working days together; and therefore for any to deny the ſame in the fourth Commandment, is in effect to deny the World their ſixed Sabbath; for thô the Goſpel firſt-day Sabbath hath a new Sanctity, yet it is founded on the old Law, and Gods ſanctifying of the ſeventh day for Man from the beginning; or elſe it is left very dubious, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59311:12"/>we are bound to keep any fixed day of Reſt at all; but as there is the ſame Moral reaſon for a Sabbath as was before, ſo we have reaſon to conclude, that the ſame Law in the fourth Commandment is morally binding to us all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſhall offer ſome Reaſons, for ſatisfaction wherefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Lord was pleaſed to ſanctifie the Sabbath, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the fourth Command to obſerve it under the name of the <hi>ſeventh day,</hi> rather than of <hi>the firſt</hi> day Sabbath. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe althô Man abſtained from work on the firſt day after he was compleatly formed, yet ſeeing God gave the Sanctity to the Day, for a Memorial of his Creation, and for Man to worſhip him, there was reaſon that the day ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the memorial of his finiſhing of, and ceaſing from the work of Creation, rather than of <hi>Adams</hi> ſolemn entring upon his ſubordinate Dominion under God, <hi>viz.</hi> in Honour to the Creator rather than to the Creature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thô <hi>Adam</hi> reſted, or rather abſtained from Work on God's Sabbath before he had paſſed ſix working days, that he might perform his moral Worſhip to God, (before he dreſſed the Garden, or meddled in his own Affairs) and praiſe him for the Lordſhip he had received over the Creatures which God had made; and ſo with reſpect to the chief Moral end for which the Sabbath was firſt made for Man, it might have properly been called the firſt day Sabbath throughout all Generations; yet ſeeing God had alſo deſigned the Sabbath to be a figure of a greater reſt, (in the ſeventh thouſand years of the World,
<note place="margin">Heb. 4.3.10. Rev. 20.4, 5, 7.</note> as it is believed by many Chriſtians) it therefore could not have been ſo glorious a Type, if it had been delivered to us under the name of the Firſt day: So that the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day was appointed in the name of the ſeventh day, not to deny <hi>Adam</hi>'s Moral Obedience, in keeping his firſt day Sabbath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſix working days, to be a pattern to his poſterity, or that <hi>Adams</hi> firſt Sabbath could not properly be called after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſucceſſively Mans firſt days Sabbath, but becauſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of God's Reſt, and ſo conſidered, as after Mans ſix working days did better ſuit the Memorial of God's Creation and Reſt, and the Typical uſes of the Sabbath day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Sabbath was commanded in the Name of the ſeventh day and not of the firſt, becauſe tho God abſtained from Work before the Creation, yet it could not be ſaid he Reſted, Ceaſed or Abſtained from Work a day before a Day was made, or there
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59311:13"/>was time meaſured by a day. So that the neceſſity of Nature placed Gods Sabbath after his Creation days, but there was not the like neceſſity that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have his Sabbath before his ſix working days; and therefore ſeeing that God ſanctified the ſeventh day, on which he ceaſed from his Works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with reſpect to Man, that Man ſhould abſtain from his Work to Worſhip him,
<note place="margin">Mal. 3.6. Iſal. 40.28. Heb. 13.8.</note> and not becauſe that God himſelf had need of reſt (for he fainteth not, nor is weary, neither is the moſt high changeable or ſubject to accidents in his Nature.) Then the ſeventh-day Sabbath bore this Name from the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Nature in Gods Example of meaſuring time, more than from its proper Nature, immediate End and principal Uſe to Man, for in all theſe reſpects, <hi>Adams</hi> firſt Sabbath was his firſt days Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Sabbath was expreſly ſanctified in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2, 3. and in the fourth Command in theſe Words <hi>[the] ſeventh day,</hi> and not <hi>[a]</hi> ſeventh day, to preſerve the conſtant Order of our ſix Working days together, and that men ſhould not chooſe any one day in the Week, and at their own Pleaſures alter the Sabbath to any different day, as to the firſt day in one Week, and the ſecond or third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Weeks following: ſo as they keep one or a day in ſeven in every Week. Moreover it is not ſaid <hi>[a]</hi> but <hi>[the]</hi> ſeventh-day, to prevent Mens Alteration of it to any other day than what we have a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern for in the Holy Scriptures, that as it was to bind <hi>Adam</hi> and others after him, to the Obſervation of <hi>[the]</hi> ſeventh-day ſucceſſively after his firſt days Sabbath without Alteration, ſo it was to oblige <hi>Iſrael</hi> to keep <hi>[the]</hi> ſeventh-day Sabbath ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively after their firſt Sabbath in the Wilderneſs without a change, and to tye us, that foraſmuch as the Jewiſh ſeventh-day Sabbath is abrogated in the New Teſtament, as you may ſee afterwards in this Treatiſe; and that we have a Pattern left us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the firſt day of the Jewiſh Week, that from thence we ſhould keep our Chriſtian Sabbath ſucceſſively on <hi>[the]</hi> ſeventh-day, after its firſt taking place by the aboliſhing of the Jewiſh Sabbath in the New Teſtament without Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<note place="margin">Coloſ. 2.16, 17</note> as <hi>Adam</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelits</hi> did after their firſt days Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which if the Sabbath in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2, 3. and in the fourth Command had been ſanctified in the expreſs Words of <hi>[a]</hi> ſeventh-day, and not of <hi>[the]</hi> ſeventh-day, it might have occaſioned Doubts and Confuſions about the Obſervation of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59311:13"/>aforeſaid ſeveral Sabbaths, but it being expreſly commanded in theſe Words <hi>[the ſeventh-day]</hi> it does ſignifie the Mind of God ſo clearly, as both to prevent ſuch Confuſions, and yet to preſerve the Moral Law in the Fourth Commandment unvio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated under the change that hath been made of the Sabbath.</p>

               <p>HEre I ſhall prove both from the Holy Scriptures and the Courſe and Neceſſity of Nature, that the Jewiſh ſeventh-day Sabbath is Ceremonial, and not Morally binding to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. This appeareth, in that it was not only a ſign to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as our Goſpel Sabbath conſidered, as the ſeventh-day is to us, that <hi>in ſix days the Lord made Heaven and Earth,
<note place="margin">Exod. 31.13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</note> and on the ſeventh-day he reſted;</hi> but it was alſo a Sign and a Covenant throughout their Generations, that they ſhould remember that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a Servant in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that the Lord their God brought them out thence through a Mighty hand and by a ſtretched out Arm;
<note place="margin">Deut. 5.15.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>the Lord their God commanded them to keep the Sabbath-day.</hi> So then as their Sabbath was a Sign of their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> (with reſpect to their Beginning and Ending of it, from Evening to Evening, thereby to ſuit their other new days Beginning from their firſt Paſſover Evening, and ſo to keep that deliverance in freſher Memory) it is Ceremonial, and ceaſeth as other Sabbaths and Memorials of that Deliverance have done, by the coming of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The old Jewiſh ſeventh-day Sabbath is proved to be Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, by the Apoſtles Words, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>Let no Man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore judge you in Meat or in Drink, or in reſpect of an Holy-day, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, in part of a Feaſt, or of the New Moon, or of the Sabbath-days: Which are a ſhadow of things to come, but the Body is of Chriſt.</hi> For as the Holy-day or Feaſt-days, New Moon and Sabbaths herein mentioned, muſt be taken for thoſe written by <hi>Moſes</hi> and given to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe thoſe only (and not the <hi>Heathen</hi> Idolatrous Holy-days) were given of God as Types and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of good things to come, ſo the Sabbath-days there di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly expreſſed from other Holy-days appointed for the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> muſt be taken for their weekly ſeventh-days Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and the two Verſes plainly comprehends all their Sabbaths
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59311:14"/>and Holy-days to be but Shadows of Things to come. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>the Body is of Chriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome do ſay, the Word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>of Sabbaths</hi> here ought to be rendred Weeks, as the ſame Greek Word is rendred, <hi>John</hi> 20.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.1. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The Word <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in Greek <hi>Sabbaton,</hi> uſed in thoſe places, is not there tranſlated Week, for any other Reaſon than becauſe it was cuſtomary to call the days of the Week, the days of the Sabbath, as the Greek Word <hi>Sabbaton</hi> properly ſignifies, but in the Text, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>of the Sabbaths</hi> (for ſo it is in the Greek, and not <hi>Sabbath-days</hi> as we tranſlate it) is not their joined, as in thoſe other places, to expreſs any particular day of the Week, but ſtands ſingly of its ſelf for <hi>Sabbaths;</hi> and therefore can only be underſtood of the Sabbath-days themſelves, which the Word properly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and cannot be otherwiſe underſtood, but at leaſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſively of the ſeventh-day weekly Sabbath, becauſe other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or Feaſt-days are in the ſame verſe expreſly named diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by themſelves.</p>
               <p>So then ſeeing the ſeventh-day Sabbath is included with the New Moon, and other Holy or Feaſt-days, as Shadows of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fpel things, it was alſo aboliſhed with them; and there is the like Ceremonial Reaſon for it, as there is for thoſe other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-days,
<note place="margin">Gal. 3. to <hi>v.</hi> 4. Chap. 4.3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 21. Chap. 5.1. to 5.

For to imagine that our Lord Jeſus, who is faithful over his own Houſe,
<note place="margin">Heb. 3.6.</note> ſhould by his Apoſtle ſo reprove the Obſervation of the Jewiſh Days and Times in general, and Name their Sabbaths diſtinctly from other Holy-days, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them all to be but ſhadows, which are to be done away and changed with the Prieſthood,
<note place="margin">Heb. 7.12.</note> without one word of Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the New Teſtament, to confirm the Jewiſh ſeventh-day Sabbath for our Obſervation; nor to leave us one Example of any Chriſtian Churches Cuſtom to meet on that day, but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59311:14"/>on the firſt Day of the Week, and yet to require us to keep their Sabbath, is groundleſs and irrational to believe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I come to prove the Jewiſh ſeventh day Sabbath to be Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, and not Morally binding to all Nations, from the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Nature, which renders it impracticable in divers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys; and in Order therunto, I ſhall firſt Premiſe four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was commanded <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they ſhould celebrate their Sabbaths <hi>from Evening to Evening;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lev. 23.32.</note> and if after the Jewiſh Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, the Sabbath muſt begin and end at Evening in every part of the World, then in ſome parts of it the Sabbath would begin when it endeth in other places, and ſo it could not be Gods deſign to bind all men to keep their Sabbath at one Point of Time prefixed to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, or in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Moſaical ſeventh-day Sabbath could not be the ſame Succeſſive ſeventh-day Sabbath from the Creation, if this were either ſucceſſively kept before their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers; or if theſe Patriarchs began and ended their Days and Weeks ſucceſſively in the ſame Order of Time from the Creation. For God was pleaſed (to the end, as it is believed, that he might more effectually draw his People from the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the <hi>Heathen</hi>) to alter the account of the beginning and ending of their days and years in ſacred things, to what it was before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were delivered out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to what was afterwards obſerved by them in Civil things, and this appears by the Evidence of divers Authors, and from the Teſtimony of the Sacred Scriptures. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. We find in Scripture, that the account of the beginning and ending of the Year was altered to the <hi>Jews</hi> at their coming out of the Land of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 12.2, 8. <hi>This Month</hi> (viz. <hi>Abib</hi>) <hi>ſhall be unto you the beginning of Months: it ſhall be the firſt Month of the Year to you;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. <hi>ch.</hi> 13.3, 4.</note> which Month is partly in our <hi>March</hi> and partly in <hi>April.</hi> Thus their Sacred Year began, but their Civil Year began after their Ingathering of the Fruits of the Feild,
<note place="margin">Exod. 23.16. Chap. 34.22. Levit. 25.89.</note> for then it is ſaid to be the End of the Year in their ſeventh Month of <hi>Tiſri</hi> or <hi>Ethanim,</hi> partly in our <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> for on the tenth day of this Month was the Trumpet blown to begin their fiftieth year of Jubilee. And this Mr. <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> noteth on <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.11. where he ſaith. <q>The <hi>ſecond Month,</hi> to wit, of the Year agreeable in part to that we call <hi>October.</hi> For the End and Revolution of the Year was about the Month
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59311:15"/>which we call <hi>September, Exod.</hi> 23.16. and 34.22. and ſo the New Year then began: This was after called the Month of <hi>Enthanim,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.2. where the <hi>Chaldee</hi> paraphraſeth, that they called it of Old the Firſt Month, but now (ſaith he) it is the ſeventh month, for the Year changed the beginning of it Eccleſiaſtically, upon the coming of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſee <hi>Euod.</hi> 12.2. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.39. compared with <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.16. And Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> farther ſaith on <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.2. By Reaſon of this their going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Year which before began in <hi>September, Exod.</hi> 23.16. hath his beginning to the Jews Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtically in <hi>Abib,</hi> or <hi>March;</hi> but for the Jubilees, and Civil Affairs, it began as it had done before, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.8, 9, 10.</q> And to this agreeth Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Annotations, on <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.2. And Mr. <hi>Godwyn</hi> in his <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> page 85. 86. and Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> in his Works, <hi>Vol.</hi> 2. page 853. ſaith, <q>It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that from the Creation the Year began in <hi>September,</hi> the <hi>Autumnal Equinox,</hi> the Fruit being on the Trees at the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but now God orders the beginning of the Year from the time of this firſt Paſſeover — which was in <hi>March,</hi> the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Equinox.</q> Laſtly, Mr. <hi>And. Willet</hi> in his <hi>Hexapla</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.2. ſpeaking of this alteration of the Year, agreeth with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that the Jews Eccleſiaſtical Year began in their firſt Month called <hi>Abib,</hi> and that their Civil Year began in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Month; yet his Opinion is, that this Sacred Year began in renovation of the former account diſcontinued in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but he citeth <hi>Joſephus,</hi> to whom (ſaith he) conſenteth <hi>Perertus, Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> that the Hebrews always before this time, held the ſeventh Month to be the firſt Month, as they did afterwards for the computation of Jubilee, and for other Civil Matters. As to <hi>Joſephus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Willet</hi> gives his ſenſe out of his Book, in the Greek, Latin, or ſome other Tongue; for our late Engliſh Tranſlation hath either from a corrupt Copy, or default in the Tranſlator, or Printer, an apparent Error, <hi>viz. December</hi> is put inſtead of <hi>September,</hi> or as the Year began before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I find there was alſo an alteration made of the Account of the beginning and ending of their days, to what they were before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were delivered out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or before their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>

As its ſaid, <hi>The Earth was without form, and void, and darkneſs</hi> (or gloomineſs) <hi>was upon the face of the deep:</hi> And then the light and darkneſs was mixed and confuſed together; and ſo if the order of expreſſion of Gods perfecting any piece of the Creation, does carry any precedency in order of time, then the Day-light did Originally go before its Night; but I conceive that neither of them was perfectly formed before the other, for its ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. that <hi>God divided the light from the darkneſs,</hi> which plainly ſheweth they were mixed together, and that he ſeparated the Day from the Night, that they ſhould no more be mixed and confuſed together, as they were before, but ſhould be diſtinctly placed in the two Hemiſpheres, ſucceſſively to circulate round the Heavens. So that at the ſame time when the Light was ſeparated into one Hemiſphere, or half part of the Heavens, the Darkneſs was placed in the other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither of them were perfectly formed before the other in time. Its true,

But from this Paſſeover, the account of the Natural Day was altered, and by God's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment was put back a whole Night, for the Paſſeover was killed and prepared on the fourteenth day at Evening, from whence the firſt day of unleavened Bread began, and the Feaſt continued till the one and twentieth day at Evening, which is juſt ſeven days according to the Commandment, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.17, 18, 19. But yet obſerve in <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.6. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.17. it is ſaid, that on the fifteenth day is the Feaſt of unleavened Bread ſeven days, which to reckon it to begin from the morrow, or next morning after the Paſſeover, as before is ſhewed <hi>Numb.</hi> 33.3. on account of their Civil days, like as was reckon'd in <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Jacob's</hi> time, would come ſhort a whole night of the ſeven days appointed from the fourteenth day at Even till the one and twentieth day at Even: And therefore I ſee no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to make up the full ſeven days, than to begin their fifteenth Sacred Day, at or after the Evening and end of their Civil or common fourteenth artificial Day of Day-light, which cuts off its following Night belonging to it, and ſo puts that Night to the following Day-light, and thereby maketh a new Sacred fifteenth day of the Night of the Civil fourteenth day, and the Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of the Civil fifteenth Day put together; and from thence in an orderly Succeſſion their Sacred time was meaſured for the due obſerving of thoſe Feaſts, Sabbaths, and Holy-days which God commanded the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But for their Civil Affairs, they ſtill accounted their days from Morning to Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.10. <hi>And David fled and eſcaped that night.

And to this Mr. <hi>Tho. Godwin</hi> witneſſeth in his Book, called <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> page 80. where he tells us, <q>That the Jews Natural Day was two-fold: Civil, a working Day, which was deſtined for Civil Buſineſſes and Works. This (ſaith he) began at Sun-riſing, and held till the next Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.1. Or Sacred, a Feſtival, or holy-day, deſtined for Holy Exerciſes: This began at Sun-ſet, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the next Sun-ſet.</q> From all which both Sacred and Humane Evidence, I ſhall make this Inference, That if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs before and after the Flood, and the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively had either kept the ſame preciſe ſeventh day Sabbath from the Creation, or had reckoned the time of their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ending of their Days and Weeks preciſely and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively from thence, (althô their Sabbath might not have been duely obſerved in their bondage,) then the Jewiſh Sabbath <hi>from Evening to Evening,</hi> after the Alteration of the account of the day, could not be the preciſe ſucceſſive ſeventh day from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And ſeeing the Scripture is ſilent in fixing the Jewiſh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, or any other Day as that preciſe ſucceſſive ſeventh day, we cannot tell which is the ſame ſucceſſive ſeventh day from the firſt ſeventh day of Reſt which God Sanctified.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I premiſe, That if the Reaſons I have given for <hi>Adams</hi> beginning his firſt Sabbath day in the Morning with the Day-light in that Hemiſphere of the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> ſhould be counted by our Opponents too weak to draw a concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a pattern to juſtifie us in beginning our Sabbath in the Morning, and any ſhould ſtill hold the keeping of the Sabbath <hi>from Evening to Evening</hi> to be ſucceſſively from the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then we have this to argue againſt their Opinion, That as they have no Scripture for it, ſo the Sun was not made till the fourth day of the Creation; and we know not in what part of that day it was Sun-riſing or Sun-ſetting, or Noon or Mid-night in any Horizon or Hemiſphere, except we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that <hi>Adam</hi> began his firſt Sabbath with the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and then it follows that a little before the fourth
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59311:18"/>day was ended, it was about as much before the beginning of the fifth day with the Morning or Sun-riſing in <hi>Eden,</hi> otherwiſe as it cannot then be known where the ſeventh day of God's Reſt (which had the ſame ſucceſſive proportion of time as the ſix days of Creation) was bounded with the riſing and ſetting of the Sun, but that when God's ſeventh day of Reſt after his ſixth day of Creation began and ended any where, it began and ended every where at the ſame inſtant ſeaſon, and it was no where then any other than the ſeventh day, which began in ſome places at Evening, in others at Morning, in others at Midnight, in others at Noon, and in ſome or other places at all hours of the Day and Night, and the Revolution of the Light and Darkneſs, was the Day which is called Natural, in diſtinction to that which is by ſome called the Artificial Day, or Day-light only. There cannot therefore from the firſt ſeventh day of God's Reſt be any footing of account to meaſure out to us the time of day for the beginning of our Day, nor conſequently for the beginning and ending of our Sabbath-day, for that it is not known to us where the Sun was when that ſeventh day of God's Reſt firſt began, unleſs we give way to what hath been clearly demonſtrated from the Scripture, that the Sun aroſe, or was about riſing then to Paradice; and to believe, as there is reaſon for it, that <hi>Adam</hi> had that whole Day-light ſanctified which preceded the Night of his Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is very clear that God did never deſign the Law and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Sabbath to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, to bind either Jews or Gentiles to the obſervation of the preciſe orderly Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of their ſeventh day Sabbath, as from the Creation to the end of the World; becauſe we find that God himſelf did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards make an interruption of the Natural Order of the account of Time, when the Sun was brought backward ten degrees in the Dial of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and when it ſtood ſtill in the midſt of Heaver about a whole Day.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the Suns going backward ten degrees,
<note place="margin">Iſai. 38.8. See his Book, <hi>Page</hi> 157.158</note> Mr. <hi>Weems</hi> in his <hi>Chriſtian Synagogue,</hi> has made a draught of <hi>Ahaz</hi> Dial, and explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the matter, telling us that that Day was prolonged twenty two hours, reckoning the ten degrees or diviſions on the Dial to be five hours backward, and then the Suns going forward again, is 5 hours more, with twelve hours, is twenty two hours Day-light in all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is ſaid, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.13. <hi>So the Sun ſtood ſtill in the midſt of Heaven, and haſted not to go down about a whole day.</hi> Now if we
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59311:19"/>duely conſider this place, it ſeems by the Suns ſtanding ſtill in the midſt of Heaven, that it ſtood ſtill in the Meridian, or Noon-tide of <hi>Canaan</hi> about a whole day; and add to the time of its ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill the half, or that part of the Day that was paſt before, and that followed after, when the Sun moved forwards to its going down, and then that Day or Day-light continued twenty four hours, or was about as long as the Day and Night together: and ſo if the Jews did reckon all that large Day-light to belong to the preceding Night, then the beginning of their next Sabbath fell later than its uſual courſe about twelve hours time, and if they divided that long Day-light, and put half of it to the former, and half of it to the following Night, then they did thereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beginning of their Natural Day for Sacred things, and reckon that laſt twelve hours of Day-light for the former part of the Day belonging to the following Night, but ſuch a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of days for Sacred things, was againſt the Command of God for the Time and Order of beginning and ending all their Sabbaths and Holy-days. But inſtead of theſe, if any ſhould yet ſay, That when the Sun had continued in their Hemiſphere about twenty four hours time, the Natural Courſe of the Night being altered, and its time ſpent by the long duration of that Day, God was pleaſed in an inſtant either to paſs the Sun thrô their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pode Hemiſphere, or ſuddenly to turn it backward, and make it Sun-riſing to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, That if thus it was, that in an inſtant the Sun was paſſed through their Horizon, and the Antipode Hemiſphere, then they reckoned the firſt twelve hours of that long Day-light of twenty four hours for one Artificial Day, or Day-light, and the laſt twelve hours Day inſtead of Night, adding one to its preceding Night, and the other inſtead of a Night to the following Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and ſo did bring their days into their former courſe again. But as this would have been a greater Miracle than the former, which was only a ſtop to the Courſe of Nature for a time, ſo there is reaſon to believe that if it had been ſo, the Holy Ghoſt would have recorded it in the Scripture, and <hi>Joſephus</hi> would not have omitted the Notice of it in his Hiſtory, where he ſpeaks of this larger Day than ordinary. And as to the laſt, if the Sun had been ſuddenly turned backward to make it Sun-riſing in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> then it could not have been ſo properly ſaid, that <hi>the Sun haſted not to go down about a whole day:</hi> For if the Sun had been ſuddenly put backward from its place of ſetting to its
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59311:19"/>place of riſing, then the Sun had only haſted from its ſtanding ſtill to the place of its going down, and went not down, till a day-light and a halfs-time after it ſtood ſtill in the midſt of Heaven, contrary to the plain meaning of the Text. And if we ſay the Sun was turned backwards from the place it ſtood ſtill, or from thence was paſſed in an inſtant through their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipode Hemiſphere to its place of riſing, or which ever way we reckon from that time the Account of the natural courſe of the Day and Night to ſettle; the <hi>Jews</hi> could not poſſibly fall into their due Order of Time again, as ſucceſſively from their former Cuſtom to begin their Sabbaths at Even, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law, unleſs it were ſettled by a greater Miracle than the ſtanding ſtill of the Sun. But if we reckon, as there is the greateſt Reaſon for it, and it is moſt natural and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implyed in the Text, that after the Sun had ſtood ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a whole day, or twelve hours, it then continued its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural courſe to go down, and add to it the ten hours of the Suns going backward and returning in the Dial of <hi>Ahaz</hi> (which twenty two hours together being computed after the Jewiſh Cuſtom of ſome of their Days-light or Artificial-days, may make a full day and nights time) and then the Jewiſh Sabbath fell later than its former preciſe Order of Sacceſſion, by near or full a whole days time. So that their weekly ſeventh-day Sabbath after theſe Afterations of days had but about two hours (poſſibly no time at all) in the time, which by an orderly Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion ſhould have been their Sabbath, and the other twenty two hours (and poſſibly their whole Sabbath-day) was in the Time, if it had not been ſo interrupted of the firſt day of their Week, by an orderly Succeſſion from their firſt Sabbath in the Wilderneſs. And therefore it is apparent, that neither the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law nor the Ceremonial Precept for their Sabbath, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to bind us to the Obſervation of the preciſe ſucceſſive ſeventh-day from the Creation; for if it had, God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſo interrupted the courſe of Nature, and his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and Inſtitution unto Men.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Having premiſed theſe things, I proceed to ſhew, that the courſe of Nature maketh it impoſſible for all Nations to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſeventh-day Sabbath after the Jewiſh Pattern.</p>

<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic</hi> Page 7.9.</note> And therefore if the Sabbath muſt be kept <hi>from Evening to Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in all the World, after the Jewiſh pattern, then in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Northern parts their Horizontal day <hi>from Evening to

And a Confirmation of this may be fairly drawn from Mr. <hi>Bamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields</hi> own Confeſſion, who pleading for the Jewiſh Sabbath, in his Reply to Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> pag. 15. ſaith: <q>That he ſees to

And if (as he ſaith) it was no <hi>Epocha</hi> for altering the Sabbath-day, then there was no need of it, as an <hi>Epocha</hi> to direct them to keep the right Sabbath day; when if it were ſo (as he alſo ſaith) that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> were no ſtrangers to it, and that it was not forgotten but well known to them.

               <p n="2">2. I ſhall ſhew, that an expreſs Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is not only Abrogated by the Authority of Jeſus Chriſt, but he juſtifies the doing of it by the Moral Pattern in our firſt Parents, as may be ſeen in <hi>Mark</hi> 10.2, 3, 4. <hi>And the Phariſees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a Man to put away his Wife? tempting him. And he anſwered and ſaid unto them, What did Moſes command you? And they ſaid, Moſes ſuffered to write a Bill of Divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to put her away. And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, For the hardneſs of your Heart, he wrote you this Precept. But from the beginning of the Creation, God made them Male and Female. For this cauſe ſhall a man leave his Father and Mother, and cleave to his Wife; and they twain ſhall be one Fleſh — what therefore God hath joined together, let no man put aſunder. — And he ſaith unto them, whoſoever ſhall put away his Wife</hi> (Matthew ſaith <hi>except it be for Fornication</hi>) <hi>and Marry another, committeth Adultery againſt her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To prevent any miſtake about this Precept of Divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to confirm what I may conclude from our Saviours Words before recited, I ſhall conſider the Original Tranſcript of it, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.1. <hi>When a Man hath taken a Wife, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her, and it come to paſs, that ſhe find no favour in his Eyes, becauſe he hath found ſome uncleanneſs</hi> (in our Margin, it is <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Nakedneſs) in her; then let him write her a Bill of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcement, and give it in her hand, and ſend her out of his Houſe.</hi> And here I ſhall note, that this matter of Uncleanneſs or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, is not to be underſtood of Adultery or Whoredom. For the <hi>Dutch</hi> Annotations ſay, that <hi>the Hebrew Word ſignifieth Nakedneſs or Scandalouſneſs of any thing wherein the Husband ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth diſlike to her, except Whoredom</hi> or Fornication. And Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> ſaith, <q>It is any thing of Shame or Ignominy, as the <hi>Greek</hi> tranſlateth a <hi>Shameful (or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncomely) thing;</hi> and he alſo ſaith, that this is thought of ſome not to be meant
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59311:23"/>of Adultery, for which ſhe was to dye, if it were proved; but of ſome evil thing in her Conditions or Actions which diſpleaſed her Husband.
<note place="margin">Deut. 22.22.</note> So the Phraſe was uſed in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.14. for that which was uncleanly and unſeemly.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Sence of our Saviours Words clearly ſheweth, that this Law of Divorcement was deſigned for other Matters than for Whoredom or Fornication; for our Lord [<hi>owning</hi> Moſes <hi>Precept of Sufferance</hi>] to put away their Wives, excepts againſt it, unleſs it be in the Caſe of Fornication; which if it were ſo limited under the Law, then <hi>Moſes</hi> Sufferance was nothing but what our Saviour ſtill alloweth, and Chriſts Prohibition was nothing at all. This being Premiſed, it now follows that our Lord maketh that Adultery under the Goſpel, that was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſo under the Law. And from the Moral Pattern in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> he Abrogateth the Uſe and Authority of <hi>Moſes</hi> Precept, for ſuffering Men to put away their Wives for ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Cauſes than Fornication; and if the Pattern in our firſt Parents was of ſuch Moral uſe as to juſtifie our Saviours abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of a written Precept of <hi>Moſes,</hi> we have then Reaſon alſo to believe that their Example, or the Order of time of their firſt obſerving the Sabbath-day that was ſanctified for them, is of Moral uſe to us, we alſo having the Jewiſh Sabbath Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by Chriſts Authority in the New Teſtament.</p>

Mark 2.27</note> and was not allowed on that ſame day to dreſs the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> which was his appointed Work in Innocency: For if <hi>Adam</hi> had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to dreſs the Garden on the Day of God's Reſt, and was bound to begin his Sabbath after his ſix working days, or days wherein he might dreſs the Garden preciſely after God's Example, then he did keep his Sabbath on the ſixth day after God's Sabbath, and not on that ſeventh day ſucceſſively, which God had ſanctified: And if he kept no Sabbath till the next ſeventh day after God's ſeventh day of Reſt, then <hi>Adam</hi> had ſeven days in which he might dreſs the Garden before his Sabbath; ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> muſt either have kept another ſeventh day than that preciſe ſucceſſive ſeventh day which God had ſanctified, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſixth day from God's Sabbath, or have ſeven working days before his firſt Sabbath, contrary to God's Example, or elſe begin his Sabbath before his working days; and then it follows, that God's ſeventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath after his ſix days of Creation, was Man's Firſt day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath before his ſix working days, and after them the ſame ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſeventh day next following God's ſeventh day Sabbath, was alſo Man's ſeventh day Sabbath too. And ſo the ſanctifying of the ſeventh day in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. and accordingly in the Moral Law, which was afterwards given forth to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was anſwered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name either of the firſt or ſeventh day Sabbath.</p>
               <p>And farther to explain this Matter, God's ſeventh day Reſt after his ſix Creation days, was not deſigned for a Pattern to Man, that he ſhould alſo have firſt ſix working days before he kept his Sabbath, for then God would either have Created <hi>Adam</hi> with ſome other things in the beginning of his firſt days Work, and have put him in a Capacity to do ſome buſineſs the ſix Creation days, and then to reſt the ſeventh day on which God reſted, or elſe ſome other way have ordered ſix working days Originally for Man before his Sabbath; but ſeeing it was otherwiſe, it therefore followeth, that God's ſeventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was only a Pattern for Mans dividing and counting his time, and for bounding his ſix working days, that he ſhould not have more working days until a Sabbath, nor be at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo often as he pleaſeth to make any one day in ſeven his weekly Sabbath, <hi>viz.</hi> to reſt on the ſeventh day in one week, and on the ſixth, fifth, fourth, third, ſecond, or firſt day in the next week after, which would have tended to confuſion: but that Man ſhould have ſix working days together, and no more,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59311:24"/>bounded before and after with a Sabbath, as it was in <hi>Adams</hi> Pattern. And thus our Goſpel firſt-day Sabbath anſwereth the deſign of God in ſanctifying and commanding the obſervation of the ſeventh day, becauſe it is a boundary before and after to our ſix working days.</p>
               <p>Moreover, As I ſhewed before, it could not be ſaid that God reſted <hi>[a]</hi> on <hi>the day,</hi> or on <hi>[the firſt]</hi> day before the Creation, or time was meaſured by a Day, and therefore the neceſſity of the Order of Nature placed God's Sabbath after his ſix Creation days, but there was not the like neceſſity that the ſame day of Reſt which was alſo made <hi>Adams</hi> Sabbath, ſhould be before his ſix working days: So that it was fixed by the Lord in the Original Order of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eves</hi> time, that we ſhould have ſuch a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, that not only anſwereth the principal End of a Sabbath, but all Ends, and ſuiteth with the alteration of it, and with God's Example too as after <hi>Adams</hi> ſix working days. And thô <hi>Adam</hi>'s Firſt-day of Reſt, or abſtinence from his own Buſineſs was on God's ſeventh day Sabbath; yet ſeeing that Man's Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sabbath was not appointed to be kept after God's Example of working ſix days firſt before his Sabbath, we have reaſon to believe that we alſo are not to follow it farther than we find by the Example of our firſt Parents, that he deſigned it ſhould be of uſe to us. But that <hi>Adams</hi> Pattern was to explain the Mind of God in ſanctifying the ſeventh day, which I believe cannot rationally be denyed, nor that it ſhould be of Moral uſe to us, to juſtifie our keeping of the Sabbath after the Goſpel Pattern, to anſwer the deſign of God in the Moral Precept, and in his firſt ſanctifying of the ſeventh day againſt this Exception, that it cannot be ſaid to be Originally introduced by only ſix work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing days, after God's Example of making the World, ſeeing our Firſt Parents did not follow it in this particular.</p>

<note place="margin">Exod. 31.15 16, 17. Heb. 4.9. Rev. 20.4, 5, 7.</note> and was alſo afterwards a ſign of <hi>Iſraels</hi> deliverance out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> yet we find the Apoſtle makes a farther uſe of it as the Foundation Type, from whence he proveth there remaineth a Reſt to the People of God, which to anſwer the Types and the Apoſtles reaſoning in this Scripture, is taken for the ſeventh thouſand years of the World. So then to follow this inſtance, we may thus argue, that thoſe ſolemn Convocations on the legal firſt and eighth day, and their fiftieth day, which if you mind the Text was a firſt day Sabbath, next enſuing one of their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Sabbaths; a plain and clear Type of our Goſpel firſt-day Sabbath, that ſhould commence next after one of their Jewiſh
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59311:25"/>Sabbaths: And ſo their fiftieth Year of Jubilee which followed a ſeventh Year Sabbath, may figure to us, that as after ſeven Sabbaths of Weeks they had a firſt days Sabbath, and as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſeven Sabbaths of ſeven years, and all thoſe legal and external Bondages of Perſons and Things, there ſhould come a time of releaſe by ſound of Trumpet with a firſt Year Jubilee Sabbath; ſo after all the bondage of the legal Adminiſtration, there ſhould come a time of Goſpel liberty,
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.18.</note> proclaimed by the Goſpel, with a firſt days Goſpel Sabbath. Thus you ſee how theſe Types and Shadows under the Law does figure out our Goſpel firſt days Sabbath, as far, if not farther than many Types does uſually ſuit with Antitypes: but as they have often exceptions in their parallels, ſo they are not of themſelves poſitive Proofs but illuſtrations of Goſpel things, which ſeeing we have the Examples of the Primitive Chriſtian Churches keeping their Sabbath on the Firſt day following the Jews Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or on the firſt day of their Week, which does fairly and fully anſwer thoſe Typical Sabbaths under the Law, that are not applicable to any other Scripture obſerved Times under the Goſpel, nor to our Eternal Reſt, for that is not doubted to be a Reſt from Labour, and a time of Liberty; nor can it be ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to us by Time, becauſe it is Eternal, or by an Eighth day. Seeing there is a Time or Day of General Judgment of Wicked Men, between the ſeventh thouſand years of the World as ſome believe, and Eternal Reſt, then ſurely the Typical firſt Days and Years Sabbaths under the Law, does bare the greater Evidence to our firſt day Sabbath under the Goſpel: However, I have no dependance on theſe Shadows for the Juſtification of our Firſt days Sabbath, but on the ſubſtantial Law of God, and <hi>Adams</hi> Pattern anſwering the firſt Sanctification of it, to which I ſhall here add the Example of Chriſts Diſciples, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches in the New Teſtament.</p>

Now it was the Cuſtom and corrupt Tradition of the Jews when the Paſſeover Sabbath fell on the day before their weekly ſeventh day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, they made but one Sabbath, and kept their Paſſeover on their ſeventh day Sabbath, as we find they did when Chriſt was laid in the Grave, and therefore that Sabbath day being a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sabbath, was called an <hi>High Day.</hi> And the firſt day after, on which Chriſt aroſe from the dead, was no Jewiſh Sabbath, but only the Firſt day of their Week; for there are two things that do evidently and clearly ſhew, that <hi>the one of the Sabbaths</hi> in the Greek cannot be taken for any one of the Jewiſh Sabbath-days, but for the firſt day of their Week: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe that ſeeing Chriſt aroſe from the Dead on the next day after the Paſſeover Sabbath, (as it was then corruptly obſerved by the Jews) and that the Paſſeover Feaſt had but two Sabbaths, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 12.14. to 19.</note> on the firſt and ſeventh day of unleavened Bread, then foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Chriſt lay in the Grave their Paſſeover Sabbath, the Day following on which he aroſe could not be one of their Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Sabbaths. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It cannot be denyed but that Chriſt did eat the Paſſeover with his Diſciples on the right day ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Commandment, which after our vulgar ſpeech was on Thurſday Night, or in the former part of the Jews ſixth day, and on Fryday, or their ſixth day, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law the firſt day of their Paſſeover Sabbath, he was crucified; and there being no other Paſſeover Sabbath
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59311:26"/>wherein the Jews were forbidden to work till the ſeventh day of the Paſſeover Feaſt, it muſt then follow, that the Sabbath on which the Women reſted, as it's ſaid, <hi>according to the Commandment,</hi> being the next day after the firſt true Paſſeover Sabbath, was undeniably the Jews weekly ſeventh day Sabbath, and the day next enſuing called <hi>The one of the Sabbaths,</hi> and the firſt of the Sabbath on which Chriſt aroſe from the dead, muſt of neceſſity be underſtood of the Firſt day of the Jewiſh Week after their ſeventh-day Sabbath, and from thence the Chriſtians obſerve their Firſt day Sabbath wherein they ſolemnly worſhip God.</p>
               <p>And to this I ſhall cite the Confeſſion and Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Theophilus Brabourn</hi> in his Diſcourſe upon the Sabbath day,
<note place="margin">See his Book <hi>Pag:</hi> 68.</note> wherein he labours to juſtifie the keeping of the ſeventh day, <hi>Saturday</hi> Sabbath, ſaith he, <q>Remember <hi>Saturday</hi> to keep it holy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now that Sabbath day was a proper Name of one of their Week days, is apparent to all, ſince they counted all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſix days of the Week by the Sabbath day; thus the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth and laſt day of the Week they (<hi>viz.</hi> the Jews) called Sabbath-day; the firſt-day of the Week, our Sunday, they called the firſt of the Sabbath the ſecond day of the Week, our Monday, they called the ſecond of the Sabbath, our Tueſday the third of the Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

This Firſt day Sabbath at its firſt founding by the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt, thó it broke the Order of the Jewiſh working days among the Chriſtians, by taking their firſt day for our Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and their Sabbath into the Chriſtians ſix working or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon days, yet there was no breach of the Moral Law reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Order of the ſix working days, conſidered as being bounded before and after with a Sabbath, for the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath after their ſix working days being followed with a New Sabbath, made two Sabbaths together, but this neither broke the Order of the ſix working days before the Jewiſh Sabbath, nor of the ſix working days after the Chriſtian Sabbath,

From whence I obſerve, that the Chriſtians Sabbath conſidered, as both their firſt and ſeventh-day Sabbath, is like as it was in the beginning, to which Chriſt refers us in other things for a Pattern to anſwer the Moral Law, and to make void the Ceremonial Addition to it, as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And now ſince the aboliſhing of all Ceremonial Things in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that we have a Pattern for the Sabbath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us by the Practice of the Holy Apoſtles and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches in the New Teſtament, appears as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. After Chriſt aroſe from the Dead,
<note place="margin">Luke 14.1.9, 10, 13, 33, 36.</note> on the firſt day of the Week, he appeared unto his Diſciples and the eleven Apoſtles, who were gathered together on the ſame day.
<note place="margin">John 10.1.19.26.</note> And after eight days Jeſus appeared again to his Diſciples that were Aſſembled, which was on the next firſt-day, being the eighth day; for it was the cuſtom of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> after this manner to expreſs this day-week, or this day ſeven-night, as we have an Inſtance in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10.5, 12. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, come again unto me after three days, and the People departed. So Jeroboam and all the People came to Rehoboam on the third day.</hi> Which Example plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews, that after three days, was on the third day; and ſo here in the Evangeliſt after eight days, was on the eighth day, or after eight days were come, and not after they were paſt on the ninth day, as it is alſo clearly explained in <hi>Mark</hi> 8.31. <hi>The Son of Man muſt ſuffer — and be killed, and after three days riſe again.</hi> For Chriſt aroſe from the Dead, not after, but on the third day after he was Crucified. And to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in their Vulgar Diſcourſe, expreſs this day Week after the ſame manner, ſaying Over eight days; ſo that the Diſciples were aſſembled alſo on the ſecond firſt day of the Week after the Reſurrection of our Lord, who appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them on that day alſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle ordered and appointed the Churches of the <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to make their Collections for the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59311:27"/>Saints on the firſt day of the Week,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.12.</note> which buſineſs had no temporary Reaſon in it to limit the doing of it to that day; and therefore it is a clear Demonſtration, that it was the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed day of their Aſſembling together to worſhip God, and for ſuch Church Affairs; otherwiſe it's rational to believe the Apoſtle would have rather left them at Liberty to do it on any day; which Example of this Nature having ſomething of an Inſtitution in it, ſome have thought it is a ſufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of its ſelf, to juſtifie our keeping of the firſt day of the Week a Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In <hi>Acts</hi> 20.6, 7, 11. It is ſaid, that <hi>Paul</hi> abode at <hi>Troas</hi> ſeven days. <hi>And upon the firſt day of the Week, when the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples came together to break Bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the Morrow, and continued his Speech until Mid-night. — When he therefore was come up again, and had broken Bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, ſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I obſerve from this Scripture, that <hi>Paul</hi> abode there ſeven days, in which time we hear nothing of his Preaching or of the Diſciples coming together, till on the firſt day of the Week, which was the laſt of the ſeven days; ſo that <hi>Paul</hi> came thither on the ſecond day of the Week, and tarried till the uſual day of their Aſſembling together, otherwiſe he need not have ſtraitned himſelf for time, ſo as to preach till Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when he was to depart at break of day; but that it may rationally be concluded, that he could not conveniently ſee the Church in a full Aſſembly before their uſual appointed Time on the firſt day of the Week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Then they came together to <hi>break Bread, viz</hi> to eat the Lords Supper, for ſo the ſame Expreſſion is univerſally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. So that on the firſt day of the Week, the Church of <hi>Troas</hi> Aſſembled to hear the Word of God, and to ſolemnize the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt; which pattern toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Example of his Diſciples before mentioned (and the occaſion of the change of the Jewiſh Sabbath) anſwering the Precept of the Moral Law founded on the firſt ſanctifying of the Sabbath, with the Obſervation of the firſt and ſeventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Sabbath by <hi>Adam,</hi> is a ſufficient warrant for the keeping of our firſt-day Sabbath, there being both a Precept and a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Example that juſtifieth our Obſervation of it. And this I conceive to be the ſame day which St. <hi>John</hi> calls the Lords

And</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our firſt-day Sabbath better anſwered the Pattern of our firſt Parents keeping their Sabbath, than the Jewiſh Sabbath did;
<note place="margin">Gen. 1.27, 28.</note> for that after <hi>Eve</hi> was compleatly formed about the end of the ſixth Creation day, as <hi>Adam</hi> firſt entred upon his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Lordſhip, which God had given him over the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which he had made, and on his firſt day in the Earthly <hi>Paradice,</hi> on his firſt-day Sabbath: So our Lord Jeſus, thô his Soul was in the Paradiſe of Heaven,
<note place="margin">John 20.17.</note> when his Body was in the Grave, yet he was not compleatly there in Soul and Body too, till he was raiſed on the firſt-day of his Aſcenſion in our Nature, far above all Principalities and Powers, to take Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his purchaſed Inheritance and Kingdom to be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without end. So that herein our firſt-day Sabbath did Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally anſwer <hi>Adams</hi> firſt Sabbath, better than the Jewiſh ſeventh-day did in the Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eves</hi> Sabbath was Originally their firſt-day Sabbath, and after their ſix working days their ſeventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath too: So our Goſpel Sabbath is the Image or Likeneſs of it, more than the Jewiſh Sabbath is; for thô their ſeventh-day may be called their firſt-day Sabbath, reſpecting their Original keeping it in the Wilderneſs; yet the Scripture does not ſhew, that it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59311:29"/>was their firſt-day Sabbath, from ſo preciſe an <hi>Epocha</hi> of Time (or notable Event) of their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as our Goſpel Sabbath is from the preciſe <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Purchaſe of our Spiritual and Eternal Salvation; from whence it is a more proper firſt-day Sabbath, and bears a greater likeneſs to <hi>Adams</hi> Pattern (which had its preciſe <hi>Epocha</hi> of Time) than the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Sabbath does from its Original. For thô the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, was appointed to bare the Memorial of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet the Scripture does not ſhew, that it took its Original from the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Paſſover, or from the Red Sea; but contrariwiſe I find, that <hi>Iſrael came unto the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of Sin, — on the fifteenth day of the ſecond Month after their departing out of the Land of Egypt;</hi> and the following Words are:

               <p n="1">1. It is not expreſſy ſaid, that <hi>Adams</hi> firſt Sabbath was his firſt-days Sabbath.
<note place="margin">Mark 2.27.</note> But yet ſeeing Chriſt hath ſaid, the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was made for Man, and that none can deny, but that <hi>Adam</hi> was bound in Duty to God to obſerve Gods ſeventh day Sabbath, wherein he reſted from his Works of Creation, then we may inſiſt on the ſufficiency of our Evidence for <hi>Adams</hi> beginning his Sabbath in the Morning; it being ſo rationally inſerred, thô it is not in Words expreſſed in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It hath been ſhewed, how our Lord made void the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Precept of Divorcement, and juſtified the doing of it by the Moral Pattern in our firſt Parents; tho' it was not by any expreſs Word of God, nor by ſo clear an evidence from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eves</hi> being one Freſh, that he nor his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (but by a ſpecial permiſſion of God) ſhould not put away their Wives, except for Fornication; as there is Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Adam</hi> began his Sabbath in the Morning day light. And therefore, tho' Chriſt might have aboliſhed that Precept without ſetting a Moral Pattern againſt it, yet his juſtifying
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59311:31"/>the doing of it from thence,
<note place="margin">2 Tim 3.16.</note> is an Example to be of uſe to us in other Caſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have greater Reaſon to begin our Sabbath in the Morning in every Countrey, where it can be ſo obſerved, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Pattern of <hi>Adams</hi> Sabbath (and the Reaſon of its change in the New Teſtament) tho' his beginning of it ſo is but inferred from the Scripture, and not expreſſed in it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to begin it after the Jewiſh Precept at Evening; for were this univerſally binding, it could not being a Poſitive Command, accommodate the Neceſſity of Nature, for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent beginning and ending of the Sabbath, as the Pattern in <hi>Adam</hi> and the New Teſtament Example doth. And this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be one chief Reaſon, that the Jewiſh Sabbath is abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and that we have only the Pattern of <hi>Adams</hi> Sabbath left us, by rational Inference from the Scripture; and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the change of the Sabbath in the New Teſtament, for our beginning of it in the Morning, and that we have not any command fixing of it, as it was to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For 1. That would have either bound us to the preciſe Point of Time of its beginning in the Lard of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and then the Memorial of Chriſts Reſurrection early in the Morning, had not been ſignified by its beginning in other Nations, remote from their Borders; for in ſome places it muſt then begin at Noon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo its day-light there had been divided, and the Service of God diſtructed, and our worldly Affairs too much intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the meeteſt time for ſolemn Worſhip.

Such a command to ſix the beginning of the Sabbath, would have required it univerfally to begin in the Morning, or at the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Day, which is inconſiſtent with the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for many Weeks together in ſome Northern Parts of the World. And therefore, that thoſe People ſhould not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by any Law to keep ſuch a Sabbath, which they are not capable conſtantly to obſerve; God was pleaſed to leave only the Moral Precept of the fourth command, founded on his firſt ſanctifying of the Sabbath to be binding to us all; that thoſe Northern People ſhould anſwer it, by beginning their Sabbath with the firſt and ſeventh-day, or proportionable Diviſion of a day, bounding before and after their ſix working days, and allow it the ſame Proportion of Time, and ſhould preſerve the Memorial of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, by obſerving the firſt day of the Week, from, and in Diſtinction to the Jewiſh

               <p n="2">2.
<note place="margin">See <hi>Page</hi> 24.</note> I have alſo ſhewed the Reaſon we have from Scripture to believe, that after <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſleep in the Night, when the Hamane Nature was compleatly formed, and <hi>Eve</hi> was brought to him at the end of the ſixth Creation day, their Sabbath began with the Morning day light of the ſeventh-day, and the firſt day after the finiſhing of the Creation; which ſeeing the Order of Gods Working and Reſt, and the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Moral Duty of Man (when the Humane Nature was compleatly formed) to offer the firſt of Time to the Praiſe of his Creator before he ſerved himſelf, did firſt begin the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath with the day-light unto Man; we have then Reaſon to conclude, that ſuch a Sabbath is moſt morally to be obſerved by the World, as no other Sabbath can more univerſally ſuit with the Courſe of Nature in the greateſt part of it. Indeed God can by his Prerogative, and as I have ſhewed, did diſpenſe with the Alteration of the Sabbath from this firſt Pattern by a Law to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as he did by the Precept of Divorcement diſpenſe with the Moral Pattern in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> that none ſhould put away his Wife for the cauſes allowed afterwards by a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law; but this we find did not at all deſtroy the Moral Uſe and Binding Quality of the Pattern in our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents after Chriſt was come, and ſo it is with the firſt Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the Sabbath, which no doubt was binding to others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Adam,</hi> as preciſely to obſerve the ſame day, as near to the orderly Succeſſion of the ſame time, as could be, according to the allowance of the Courſe of Nature in every Climate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they dwelt.

To proceed therefore, the Apoſtle ſurely would not have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled forth the firſt-day of the Week (on which the Churches were wont to have their Aſſemblies) as the propereſt time to make their Collection for the Saints: Nor would the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> have called it the <hi>Lords day</hi> (as hath been ſhewed from Hiſtory) if it had not been a ſanctified day for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Uſe, neither would the Holy Ghoſt have Recorded the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples gathering together on the two firſt-days after the Reſurrection of Chriſt, nor that the Church of <hi>Troas</hi> came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on the firſt day of the Week, to ſolemnize the Goſpel Ordinances of Divine Worſhip, as the only Examples to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Moral Law in the fourth Commandment. If the ſame Spirit of Truth in the Apoſtle had here deſigned to make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day alike Common.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Apoſtle in this Scripture had ſo deſigned, he would not have cited ſo many Precepts of the Ten Commandments in <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.9. of the ſame Epiſtle, and have ſaid of the reſt of them, as binding to the <hi>Romans,</hi> to confirm his Moral Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, That <hi>if there be any other Commandment, it is briefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in this ſaying, namely, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59311:35"/>thy ſelf.</hi> And therefore ſeeing, he doth ſo plainly diſcover the binding quality of the Ten Commandments to the <hi>Gentile</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; there is no Reaſon to conceive, he ſhould diſſolve the Obligation of any one of them in the following Chapter; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the Liberty there mentioned of eſteeming or not eſteeming of Days, is not there reſerred or applyed, as having Retation to the Moral Obſervation of the ſourth Command.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle would not have aboliſhed (as hath been ſhewed) the Jewiſh Feaſts, Holy days and Sabbaths, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.16, 17. nor have ſaid to the <hi>Galatians, Ye obſerve Days,
<note place="margin">Gal. 4.10.</note> and Months, and Times, and Years. I am afraid of you, leaſt I have beſtowed upon you labour in Vain.</hi> If he or any other by Chriſts Authority, had given abſolute Liberty for Chriſtians to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Jewiſh Holy days. And therefore the ſence of this Text, which is freeſt from all Exceptions; is, That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle neither giveth us Liberty to ſleight the Obſervation of the ſeventh-day required of us in the fourth Commandment, as the Bond of the Goſpel Pattern; nor yet doth give us abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Liberty to obſerve the Jewiſh ſeventh-day Sabbath, and their other Holy-days; but he is teaching us, how we ſhould bear with one another in indifferent Matters, as the eating of Herbs, and eſteeming of Jewiſh days: That in Caſe a Brother ſhould be ſo weak as that after he is converted from the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Religion to the Chriſtian Faith, he ſhould ſtill retain ſome eſteem of their Holy days, yet being ſound in all the Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Principles to Salvation, and in the conſtituted Order of a Regular Goſpel Church, his Communion is not to be refuſed;
<note place="margin">Ver. 1.</note> but here let the Reader well obſerve, that my meaning is not, that any Church ſhould receive ſuch a Chriſtian into full Communion with them at the Lords Table, that holdeth and maketh our firſt-day Sabbath only as a common day to him (for this in the Judgment of a Church according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Rule, bringeth him under the guilt of Sin, and the Church ſhould not partake of it, by their holding ſuch full Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him.) But the Apoſtle means, that in Caſe a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Jew</hi> as he is there treating of, ſuch a one as maketh a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Meats to be Clean and Unclean,

                  </note> if he ſhould ſtill eſteem ſome of their Holy days, yet if he alſo keepeth the firſt-day Sabbath Holy unto the Lord, the Church in ſuch a Caſe ſhould be tender of grieving his weak Conſcience, by Continual and Uncharitable Diſputations with him about the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59311:36"/>Matter wherein he is not clearly enlightned, ſo as to give him an occaſion to ſtumble and ſall at the Offence. For ſeeing he Conſcientiouſly keepeth Holy the firſt-day Sabbath,
<note place="margin">Gal. 4.13, 15, 20, 21, 23.</note> for his retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eſteem for ſome Jewiſh Holy days, (ſo they be kept to the Lord in Chriſtian Worſhip and not for Jewiſh Sacrifices or ſuch things which betoken Chriſts not being yet come and fully exhibited in the Fleſh) we are not to deny Communion at the Lords Table with ſuch a Brother, ſeeing he neither ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth the Jewiſh days to uphold their worſhip, contrary to the Prohibition of Legal Ceremonies under the Goſpel Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, nor can any ways be charged with diſorders in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, or in Matters Eſſentially pertaining to the Regular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of a Goſpel Church. And that this is the Mind of Chriſt in the Text appeareth in two things, (1.) Becauſe the Apoſtle joineth this Liberty of Regarding, or not Regarding of days with Eating or not Eating of Meats, as things of a like indifferent Nature; but the Keeping or not Keeping of the Weekly Sabbath, hath been fully proved to be no indiſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing, but an abſolute Duty; and therefore it is none of the Subject Matter included in the Apoſtles Words. (2.) He intended to give no Liberty to obſerve the Jewiſh days for Legal Ceremonial Worſhip; for this under the Goſpel would not be counted a keeping of a day to the Lord, but not a keeping of it to him; and ſo as the Apoſtle argueth, it is not a keeping of a day at all. And thus having opened this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and given the ſence of the Apoſtles Words in Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation to the Authority of other Places, that are binding to us for the Obſervation of the Sabbath day, I ſhall leave it to the ſerious Conſideration of the Impartial Reader.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59311:36"/>in Glory: So that, that which was to be done away, does not appear to be the binding quality of the Ten Commandments, as a Rule of Holy Life or the Commandments themſelves, but the Renown of their glorious manner of Miniſtration to <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> (which is incomparable to the Revelation of the Grace of God in the Goſpel) with their power of final Condemnation, to thoſe that lay hold of, and have an Intereſt in the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Righteouſneſs by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 1. The Queſtion is, Whether the Moral Law bindeth us to keep the ſeventh-day, which men may appoint at their own pleaſures, or the ſeventh-day that we are directed unto in the Holy Scriptures.
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.17. 2 Theſ. 3.9.</note> Surely we ought to exert our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Gods Precepts after the Examples of thoſe that are

I ſay not that we ſhould follow them in all things they ever did, but in all things they did which were eſſential to anſwer any Moral or Goſpel Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept given for our Practice, and conſequently in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the firſt-day Sabbath. For ſeeing the Ceremonial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for the Sabbath is abroga ed, and the Courſe of Nature maketh it impoſſible to be morally binding to all Nations; we have then no other Directions, how to anſwer the Moral Law, but the Goſpel Pattern juſtified by the Example of our firſt Parents; and therefore we having a poſitive Law to keep the ſeventh-day Sabbath, we are under a neceſſity to make that our Pattern. For tho' the Apoſtle did go into the <hi>Jews</hi> Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and there pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59311:38"/>from all Obligations to keep any one particular day; ſo that if Chriſtians agree upon the fourth, fifth, ſixth, or any other day of the Week, to make it the ſeventh-day Sabbath after our ſix working days, it does anſwer the Mind of God in the Moral Law, as well as by keeping our firſt-day Sabbath. For altho (as I have proved) the Jewiſh Sabbath being by Law to begin at Even, was therefore never deſigned for a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Pattern to all Nations; yet who will ſay, that it was not a Pattern for the <hi>Jews</hi> in all places that had Evenings, where they did ſojourn, and where the days have no Evenings for many Revolutions of the Sun, there was no Proviſion made for their Sabbath in the Ceremonial Law which they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For God had placed <hi>Iſrael</hi> within other Nations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired all their Males three times a Year to appear before him in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And therefore,
<note place="margin">Dem. 16.16.</note> they were not to ſojourn ſo far amongſt the <hi>Heathens</hi> as thoſe Northern (or Southern) Parts, while they were a free and peculiar Kingdom of Prieſts to God.
<note place="margin">Exod. 19.5, 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So then notwithſtanding the Ceremonial Precept for the Sabbath was neither deſigned to oblige the <hi>Heathens</hi> In thoſe Northern Countreys, if they were then inhabited, nor could by Reaſon of the difference of their days accommodate the <hi>Jews</hi> to keep their Sabbaths there: Yet if that Law was bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all, under the leaſt Alteration of their Day (as I think none can doubt of that, nor conſequently that it was obliging to the <hi>Jews</hi> in other parts of the World alſo, where the days differed more in Point of Time, to begin their Sabbaths at Evening, with allowance to comply with the Neceſſity of the Courſe of Nature) I ſay then, ſeeing that Ceremonial Precept was binding under ſuch Alterations of their day, it muſt be granted that it obliged them not to vary from one another in the time of keeping their Sabbath, farther than the Neceſſity of Nature did compell them for the beginning and ending of it at the time prefixed by the Law. Otherwiſe if their Law did not ſo reſtrain them, it was of no force nor uſe to them, and conſequently if the Goſpel Pattern for us to keep the firſt day Sabbath, be any Pattern at all for us to follow, as I have ſhewed it is, it doth then oblige us to obſerve it, with no farther Allowance to alter the day, than to accommodate the Neceſſity of Nature in every Countrey where we dwell.</p>

               <p n="2">2. There is two Moral Reaſons for Man to Sabbatize or keep a Sabbath. The one is to abſtain from work, that he may devote himſelf to Worſhip his Creator; the other is to reſt and refreſh himſelf from his Toyl and Labour. Now altho' many Men have not toiled themſelves in any Work, and ſo have no need of a reſt to refreſh their Bodies; yet ſuch are bound to keep the Sabbath as well as others, in ceaſing from finding their own Pleaſure, and ſpeaking their own Words, and to Honour God on his Holy Day, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13. So then, tho' <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had not paſſed one working day, before they had Gods ſeventh-day Sabbath made for them; yet it was their Moral Duty to abſtain from Work, and to Dedicate that very day, to Attribute their Praiſe and Worſhip to him. For we find by <hi>Abels</hi> Offering the Firſtlings of his Flock,
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.4.</note> which was afterwards required of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with all the firſt Fruits of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that the firſt of all our Increaſe is moſt acceptable to God; and ſo by the ſame Rule, was the firſt of Time after the Creation. And when <hi>Adam</hi> was put into the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and had ſeen all the Cattel and Beaſts of the Field, and the Fowls of the Air; and after that had <hi>Eve</hi> brought to him, which God had formed for a help Meet for him; and had taken a little view of the Works of God in the Heavens, and on the Earth, and of his own Happy Eſtate and Lordſhip over the Creatures: Then ſurely it was his Moral
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59311:39"/>Duty, before he ſerved himſelf in any Work or Buſineſs of his own, moſt ſolemnly to Praiſe and Glorifie God for Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him after his own Image, and making him Lord over all the Earth. And this ſeemeth to have been the Work of Man and Angels, from <hi>Job</hi> 38.7. <hi>When the Morning Stars ſang together, and all the Sons of God ſhouted for Joy.</hi> For thô it may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what theſe Morning Stars are, and how they ſang; yet the Sons of God moſt properly were the Angels and Man, who bear the greateſt Likeneſs and Image of their Creator; of thoſe then its ſaid they all ſhouted for Joy; and I obſerve from the Text, that as this could not be preciſely at the ſame inſtant, when the Foundations of the Earth were laid, but rather when the Works of Creation were finiſhed; becauſe neither the Natural Stars nor Mankind were then formed: So there is no Reaſon to underſtand the Text of any Time after the fall of Man, for then the Enmity of the Evil Angels againſt God, would rather excite them to Curſe, than to Rejoice and Praiſe him for his Works. It's true the Word [<hi>all</hi>] is ſometimes taken for a part, and not the whole; but not here, for when God had finiſhed his Work on the ſixth-day, <hi>He ſaw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good.</hi> So that neither Man nor Angels were then fallen, nor before this Solemn Acclamation of Joy, for that would have been a Check unto it. Beſides, we find nothing mentioned in the Text of Redemption-Grace, but of the Works of Creation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we have the greateſt Reaſon to refer it to a Time of ſolemnizing the Praiſes of God, between the finiſhing of the Creation, and the Fall; and there is Reaſon to believe, that ſo it was; for why ſhould we imagine, that God ſhould Create all things very good and in Perfection, and never receive their perfect Homage and Praiſe. It is therefore rational to believe, that God did not ſuffer ſin to Marr the Perfection of his Works, till all was ſiniſhed and did ſhew forth his Praiſe. And then if Man had a time in Perſection to ſolemnize the Praiſe of his Creator, when could it beſt be done, but in the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied time of Abſtinence from his own buſineſs?

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59311:40"/>toilſome but delight ſome to him; for <hi>Adams</hi> eating his Bread in Sorrow, and with the Sweat of his Face, came by the Curſe that fell upon him for his Sin; ſeeing therefore the Sabbath at its firſt ſanctifying, was not principally Hallowed for Man to reſt and refreſh his weary Body, which became one Moral end of it through the Accident of Sin forſeen by God; but that it was firſt ſanctified for Man to abſtain from Work, moſt ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to worſhip his Creator before he ſerved in his own Affairs; and conſidering God himſelf had no need of a Day of Reſt, for he fainteth not, nor is weary; and ſo his Declaration of it was for the Sake of Man to exert his worſhip to him; we may then conclude that <hi>Adams</hi> firſt Sabbath was moſt properly fixed before his ſix working days, to anſwer the Prime and Chief end of Hallowing of it, after ſuch manner as beſt became our firſt Parents in the State of Innocency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 5. But ſome may ſay, Thô by <hi>Adams</hi> firſt keeping his Sabbath, we have no Example for beginning our Sabbath, originally after our ſix working days, yet the ſix days in which <hi>Iſrael</hi> firſt gathered Manna was to ſettle the keeping of their Sabbath, as after their ſix working days, and not before them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. Tho gathering Manna ſix days before their firſt Sabbath in the Wilderneſs, is no where aſſigned as a ſixing their firſt Sabbath, after no more than ſix working days. But it rather appears, as to Man an Accidental thing: For we find that God firſt gave the People Manna upon their murmuring, becauſe of hunger. Beſides, if God had deſigned to ſix ſix working days before their firſt Sabbath, it would better have ſuited ſuch an end, for God to have ſanctified the ſeventh-day from their firſt Paſſover, or from the Red Sea, when they were delivered from <hi>Pharaohs</hi> purſuing of them; but notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Iſrael</hi> were freed from the fear of their Enemies, and had nothing, as I can find, to hinder their reſting on the next ſeventh-day after, yet if we reckon the day on which <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſang and danced before the Lord for Joy of their Deliverance; and the three days they were in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Shur,</hi> and after that their coming to <hi>Morah,</hi> and their Incamping after that at <hi>Elim</hi> by the twelve Wells of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſeventy Palm Trees, from whence they removed unto the Wilderneſs of <hi>Sin,</hi> where they murmured for Bread; and alſo count unto the day of their gathering Manna, we cannot
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59311:40"/>rationally allow ſo little as ſeven days time, and yet it was the ſeventh-day after all this, which was their firſt Sabbath in the Wilderneſs, in which time from their coming from the Red Sea, they might have had at leaſt two ſeventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths; and therefore I ſee no Reaſon to believe, that their ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Manna ſix days before their Sabbath, was deſigned of God as a ſixing ſix working days before their firſt Sabbath, ſeeing neither the Scripture does ſo aſſign it, nor that the Lord did appoint either the firſt ſeventh-day, after their firſt Paſſover, or after their Deliverance from the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> to be their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; but ſuffered them to break ſuch an Order, by having more than ſix working days unto their firſt Sabbath after their Deliverance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Lord had deſigned to make the Sabbath next after the firſt ſix days of <hi>Iſraels</hi> gathering Manna, a Pattern for all Nations to have anſwered the Moral Law; in keeping the ſame ſeventh-day Sabbath preciſely and ſucceſſively from that Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Point of Time, he would not have abſolutely limited the beginning and ending of it, to be obſerved <hi>from Evening to Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but would have leſt the beginning and ending thereof to other Times of the Day and Night, as would ſuit with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation, and render them capable to anſwer the Moral End and Equity of the Law.</p>

The Sabbath was inſtituted and ſixed to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, before the Law was given on Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and therefore it did not pertain unto it, as a Molaical new day; but as it was ſanctified from the Creation it was then reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſoon after repeated and conſirmed again in the fourth Commandment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. I have already ſhewed, that <hi>Adams</hi> Sabbath and the days afterwards, began with the Morning day-light. And that after <hi>Iſraels</hi> departure out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the account of their days for their Sabbaths and Holy things, were changed from what they were reckoned before, in <hi>Adams, Lots, Jacobs</hi> and <hi>Labans</hi> time. So that by that account of the beginning and ending of their days, the Jewiſh Sabbath could not be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſucceſſive ſeventh-day reſt from the Creation. And conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, it was never aſſigned in Scripture to be the ſame, but rather another day, to draw the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the Idolatry of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> who worſhipped the Sun on our firſt-day, called therefore Sunday, which is believed to be moſt likely the old ſeventh-day from the Creation. And alſo ſeeing, the Lord himſelf interrupted the orderly Courſe of Nature, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the preciſe Succeſſion of the Jewiſh ſeventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: There is therefore no Reaſon to think, that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath fixed to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs was the preciſe ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſeventh-day from the Creation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thô the Sabbath was given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> before the Law was promulgated on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> yet it follows not, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was that old preciſe ſeventh-day; for if this ſhould paſs for ſufficient proof thereof, then we may ſay the Month of <hi>Abib,</hi>

And by the Feaſt of Tabernacles, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.16. which places both relate to Chriſts Glorious Kingdom yet to come, and not to our preſent Goſpel-day; but yet we cannot certainly ſay, what the New Moon and Feaſt of Tabernacles does particularly ſhadow to us: Howbeit from thence it's plain, that the New Moon is a ſhadow of ſomething yet to come, and ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith ſo too, and comprehends the ſeventh-day Sabbath with it; we can no more deny his forbidding all Men not to judge (or cenſure) the Chriſtians for not obſerving the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſeventh-day Sabbath, than for not obſerving their New Moons, and other Holy days; and for any to except the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſeventh-day Sabbath out of this Prohibition, becauſe they ſind no preſent Goſpel Antitype ſhadowed by it, expreſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to it in the New Teſtament; will give equal Liberty for others to except againſt the Prohibition of obſerving their New Moons. And therefore, ſeeing thoſe Typical days and times of the New Moon, and Feaſt of Tabernacles, that were not evident ſhadows of preſent, but of ſuture Goſpel things, are not to be kept in our Goſpel days, as Signs and Memorials of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or for any other Reaſon; and yet the Record of them in Scripture does retain their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical and Shadowy Significations; then ſurely we have equal Reaſon to conclude, that in Caſe it were granted (as it is not) that the Jewiſh ſeventh-day Sabbath was no ſhadow of any preſent Goſpel thing; yet as a Sign and Memorial of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and alſo as a ſhadow of ſuture things, it is not to be obſerved, tho' the Record of it in Scripture, does ſtill retain a ſhadowy Signification; and is ſo of Uſe to us.</p>

The Jewiſh Sabbath its ſelf is abrogated, without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of any part of the Moral Law, or Ten Commandments, or any Moral Branch of that Law; tho' the keeping of it by the <hi>Jews</hi> did anſwer and fulfil it in the fourth Command. For as I have noted, the fourth Command of its ſelf, does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Sabbath to begin and end <hi>from Evening to Evening;</hi> ſo it conſequently follows, it does not of its ſelf limit the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that very day; but this was done by another Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Precept, which till it was abrogated, tho' it anſwered the Moral Law, as being their ſeventh-day boundary to their ſix working days; yet it does not therefore follow, that it was of its ſelf of a Moral Nature; for then we muſt alſo ſay, that all other Ceremonial Precepts are Moral, and all the Jewiſh Worſhip is Moral; for nothing was required contrary to the Ten Commandments, but for <hi>Iſraels</hi> putting forth their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them; which was to be exerted according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will of God, in all the other Appendant both Moral and Ceremonial Precepts and Branches of the Decalogue. So that the prohibiting of the Sabbath, according to the Jewiſh Pattern is no repeal of any Part or Moral Branch of the Ten Commandments, but is only an Abrogation of a Ceremonial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that pertained to it, during the ſhadowy Diſpenſation of the Law.</p>

And therefore, as it cannot be proved by any other Scripture, that by dark places in the Text are meant thoſe Countreys; but that the matter connexed to the Text, implies it to and expounds it of dark Perſons, if it were granted, as it is not, that by dark places is meant thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, it is ſufficient to invalidate all that is there ſaid by Mr.
